Three ways to convert data to image in a WPF application.
 
1. Convert html string to image using [HTML-Renderer](https://github.com/ArthurHub/HTML-Renderer).
Inspired by [Convert HTML string to image](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17832304/convert-html-string-to-image) 

2. Render WPF control directly to images.

3. In the background, convert html format data to images with CefSharp, obtaining relatively good image quality.
